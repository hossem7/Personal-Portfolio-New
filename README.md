# Personal-Portfolio-New

New and updated Personal Portfolio higlighting my career so far and things I've accomplished. More specifically, it showcases a biography of myself, skills I've picked up, personal projects I've developed and my professional experiences. The website is also full responsive across devices of your choice. Additionally, I added a contact section for anyone to contact me.

I used Sanity CMS to manage the content of the website.
